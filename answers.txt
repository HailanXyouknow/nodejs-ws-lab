Question 1: What do you see in the browser? 

When you open another tab and perform a click/drag action, what happens?



  A bunny is shown on a black screen.

  When we click and drags the bunny, the bunny turns red. 

  In the second tab, the bunny 'copies' the movement we made to the bunny in the first tab.
